After opening the application, click on the icon to load the playlist (marked in the image below).

![Load playlist]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_1.png' | relative_url}})

Select your playlist (.lpl file in JSON format), then click on the icon to load your thumbnail folder.

![Load thumbnail folder]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_2.png' | relative_url}})

Then, click the button to run the fuzzy search and wait.

![Run match]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_3.png' | relative_url}})

Thumbnails will appear in the previously loaded playlist table, as shown below.

![Run match]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_4.png' | relative_url}})

At this point, it is recommended that you review whether each image matches the corresponding game.
To help, the color of the table rows varies according to the proximity of the names.
The more red, the more chance of mismatch.

To replace or remove the wrong images, use the buttons next to each one, as shown below.

![Run match]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_5.png' | relative_url}})

After that, just click the button to save the thumbnails in the folder of your choice.

![Run match]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_7.png' | relative_url}})

Note: If some games have run out of images, you can save a temporary playlist with just them to generate these thumbnails later. Just click on the floppy disk icon.

![Run match]({{'/assets/images/Screenshot_8.png' | relative_url}})

Later, load that playlist and repeat the previous steps. Then you can delete this temporary playlist.
